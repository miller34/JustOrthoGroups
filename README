Purpose: Identify Orthologous Groups in one or more FASTA files

##########################

ARGUMENT OPTIONS:

	-h, --help            show this help message and exit
	-i [INPUT [INPUT ...]]Input Fasta Files
	-id INPUTDIR          Input Directory with Fasta Files
	-o OUTPUT             Output OrthoGroup File
	-t THREADS            Number of Cores
	-d OVERLAP            Direct Overlap
	-c OCCURANCES         Number of Occurances
	-dna                  Flag for DNA sequences
	-rna                  Flag for RNA sequences

##########################

REQUIREMENTS:

JustOrthoGroups uses Python version 2.7

Python libraries that must be installed include:
1. sys
2. os
3. multiprocessing
4. argparse
5. BioPython
6. gzip
7. collections

If any of those libraries is not currently in your Python Path, use the following command:
pip install --user [library_name]
to install the library to your path.

##########################

Input Files:
This algorithm requires one or more fasta files, or a directory which contains one or more fasta files.

Output File:
An output file is required. Ortholog groups will be assigned and written to the output file.

##########################

USAGE:

Typical usage requires the -i and -o options. When using -i, input file names are space separated, 
with one or more files required. The algorithm with compare all protein sequences in all files to find 
the best global orthologous groups.

The default number of threads is 1. If you want to change that, use the -t option.

The default direct overlap region length is 6. 
	Raising this value will decrease the number of genes in each orthologous group. 

The default number of occurances required is 4. 
	Raising this value will decrease the number of genes in each orthologous group. 


Example usage:
python justOrthoGroups.py -id test -o testOut
python justOrthoGroups.py -i test/test1.fa test/test1.fa -o testOut


Running one of the above commands will produce a single output file called outputGroups in the current directory.
